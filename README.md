## 🧠 Why CollabVerse

Unlike LinkedIn, which connects people for jobs, **CollabVerse connects students for collaboration**.  
It uses *real project data* instead of self-declared skills — so the network is authentic, visual, and built on actual coding work.

> 💡 CollabVerse turns your campus into a living skill map — so you can *find the right person to build with, instantly.*
